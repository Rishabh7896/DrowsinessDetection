## Drowsiness Detection

Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.

The objective of this project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

## Functions

This project notifies you if your face is not visible in the frame for a fixed amount of time. It also notifies if your eyes are closed for a fixed amount of time. The alert is in the form of a Beep Sound.
